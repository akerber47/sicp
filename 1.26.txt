By calling expmod twice each recursive step, we end up performing tree
recursion (like in the first fibonnaci example) rather than linear recursion.
Our tree has depth O(log n) and branches twice at each node, so the number of
nodes in the tree - that is, the number of calls to expmod - will be
O(2^log n) = O(n).
