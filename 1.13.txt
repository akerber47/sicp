Obviously Fib(0) = (phi^0-psi^0)/sqrt(5)
      and Fib(1) = (phi^1-psi^1)/sqrt(5)

Since Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
and phi and psi are both solutions to x^2 = x + 1,
this formula is immediately true for all n
(by induction, add the two previous formulas).

Now it suffices to observe that abs(psi^n/sqrt(5)) < 1/2 for all n > 0,
then since Fib(n) is always an integer it must be the nearest integer
to phi^n/sqrt(5).
