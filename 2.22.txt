The first version will begin by consing the squares of first (outermost)
elements of items onto the accumulator list, things, first. Then later calls to
iter will cons later elements of items onto that, resulting in them being
earlier in the list. Basically, this code is written just like reverse from
2.18 but with a squaring operation in between.

The second version does not build well-formed lists, because it passes a list
into cons as the first argument and a number in as the second.
