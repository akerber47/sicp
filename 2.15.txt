Yes. Basically, to reduce the percentage error of the result, we want to avoid
repeating intervals in our expression, because each time we repeat we need to
consider both extremes at each place in the formula, whereas we can get a
better bound by using the fact that the interval has to have a consistent value
over the formula.

As an illuminating example, consider the expression (R_1/R_1). If we simplify
this, we of course get a value of 1 (with zero error). But if we just plug in
an interval for R_1 and naively apply our division procedure, we'll find
something with a nonzero error (potentially quite large!).
